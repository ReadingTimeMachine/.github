# Welcome to the Reading Time Machine Project!

Our work focuses on digitizing the historical (published prior to 1997) holdings of the [Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) using optical character recognition (OCR) and document layout analysis.

The repository associated with our first paper [Figure and Figure Caption Extraction for Mixed Raster and Vector PDFs: Digitization of Astronomical Literature with OCR Features](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16802-4_5), published at [TPDL 2022](http://tpdl2022.dei.unipd.it/) is [figure_and_caption_extraction](https://github.com/ReadingTimeMachine/figure_and_caption_extraction).

We discuss the issue of "Generalizability" in document layout analysis as part of an invited talk at the [AEOLIAN Workshop: Making More Sense With Machines: AI/ML Methods for Interrogating and Understanding Our Textual Heritage in the Humanities, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences](https://www.aeolian-network.net/events/workshop-5/) with the conference preceedings [Generalizability in Document Layout Analysis for Scientific Article Figure & Caption Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10781).  The associated repository is [htrc_short_conf](https://github.com/ReadingTimeMachine/htrc_short_conf).
